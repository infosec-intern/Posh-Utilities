.SYNOPSIS
    Some sample ETW explorations
.DESCRIPTION
    This module contains various functions and commands related to ETW (Event Tracing for Windows).
    I really have no idea what's gonna be in it, so it probably won't be all that useful on its own.
    Any future good ideas will get their own scripts/modules.
